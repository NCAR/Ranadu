\usage{
makeNetCDF(.data, newNetCDFname)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data.frame produced by getNetCDF() or otherwise converted to the corresponding
structure from that function.}

\item{newNetCDFname}{A character path name for the file to be created}
}
\value{
a text message indicating successful creation of the new file.
}
\description{
Write a netCDF file using data from a data.frame
}
\details{
This function writes a netCDFfile that includes all variables in a data.frame.
It will not overwrite an existing file, so the file 'newNetCDFname' should be deleted
before a call to makeNetCDF if overwriting is desired.
For this routine to work effectively, the data.frame should be produced by a call to getNetCDF()
because that function also assigns attributes to the data.frame and to the variables it
contains that match those in the original netCDF file. This function extracts those
attributes and adds them to the netCDF file that is created. Note that, when subsetting,
it will be necessary to preserve the attributes; see help for getNetCDF. 
At present, this will work for low-rate and 25-Hz variables but not for 
multi-dimensional variables like hydrometeor size distributions.
