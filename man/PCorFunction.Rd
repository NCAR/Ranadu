\title{Static Defect Correction}
\usage{
PCorFunction(p, q = 100, alpha = 3, Mach = 0.8, AC = "GV")
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Measured (uncorrected) ambient pressure (e.g., PSF), hPa (no default)}

\item{q}{Measured (uncorrected) dynamic pressure (e.g., QCF), hPa (or any units that match those used for p) -- default 100 hPa. This is unused for the C-130 so it does not need to be supplied.}

\item{alpha}{Angle of attack (degrees; default +3)}

\item{Mach}{Mach number (default: 0.8)}

\item{AC}{Aircraft identifier, either "GV" of "C130" (default "GV")}
}
\value{
The ratio of the pressure correction to the measured pressure. The correction to dynamic pressure is the negative of the returned value.
}
\description{
Corrections to dynamic pressure and ambient pressure
}
\details{
This correction was determined from fits to the measurements from
the Laser Air Motion Sensor, as described by Cooper et al., 2014.
