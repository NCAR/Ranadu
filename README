These are scripts based on R that facilitate use of the netCDF data files
produced by the NCAR Research Aviation Facility, with measurements from
flights of research aircraft. The files here are made into a package
called 'Ranadu' (R-based analysis for NCAR aircraft-data users).

To rebuild:
require(devtools)
require(roxygen2)
wd("~/RStudio/Ranadu") or appropriate location of these files
document()
check()
build()
install()
