#' Package Ranadu
#' 
#' This is a package of programs designed for use with the data archives
#' that contain measurements from research flights of the NCAR/EOL/RAF
#' aircraft, normally archived in netCDF format. These routines read those
#' archives, construct R data.frames containing selected variables, and
#' provide utility functions for working with the measurements.
