Description: This package contains a function for loading a portion of a netCDF
    data file into a data.frame, and it contains a number of functions that
    implement algorithms described in ProcessingAlgorithms.pdf. The package
    depends on the ncdf and nleqslv packages. Functions included are: GetNetCDF
    (to load the data.frame), GetIndex to find the index corresponding to a
    particular time, GetStartEnd to find the time limits of the data,
    SpecificHeats for the (possibly moisture corrected) specific heats and gas
    constant for air, MachNumber, RecoveryFactor, TrueAirspeed, AirTemperature,
    MurphyKoop (for the water vapor pressure), DPfromE (to find the dew point
    corresponding to a specified water vapor pressure), PressureAltitude,
    PotentialTemperature, EquivalentPotentialTemperature,
    WetEquivalentPotentialTemperature, MixingRatio, VirtualTemperature,
    VirtualPotentialTemperature, and plotWAC and lineWAC (convenience routines
    producing some aspects of plots I use routinely). There is also a function
    providing standard constants including those defined in
    ProcessingAlgorithms.pdf. There is a utility for making subsets of a
    netCDF file, and there are other functions also.
