Description: This package contains a function for loading a portion of a netCDF
    data file into a data.frame, and it contains a number of functions that
    implement algorithms described in ProcessingAlgorithms.pdf. Two manuals are
    included, 'RanaduManual.pdf' (which describes the functions and includes a
    very short introduction to R) and 'RanaduShinyManual.pdf' which describes 
    the accompanying shiny application that provides a variety of interactive
    plot capabilities for data analysis using NCAR/RAF data files. The package
    depends on the ncdf4 and nleqslv packages. Functions included are: GetNetCDF
    (to load the data.frame), GetIndex to find the index corresponding to a
    particular time, GetStartEnd to find the time limits of the data,
    SpecificHeats for the (possibly moisture corrected) specific heats and gas
    constant for air, MachNumber, RecoveryFactor, TrueAirspeed, AirTemperature,
    MurphyKoop (for the water vapor pressure), DPfromE (to find the dew point
    corresponding to a specified water vapor pressure), PressureAltitude,
    PotentialTemperature, EquivalentPotentialTemperature,
    WetEquivalentPotentialTemperature, MixingRatio, VirtualTemperature,
    VirtualPotentialTemperature, and plotWAC and lineWAC (convenience routines
    producing some aspects of plots I use routinely). A skew-T background is
    provided by SkewT.R. There is also a function providing standard constants
    including those defined in ProcessingAlgorithms.pdf. There is a utility
    for making subsets of a netCDF file, and there are other functions also.
    One new function supports starting other programs that read netCDF-format
    files and providing such files generated from R data.frames.
